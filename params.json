Here you can set the following parameters:\r\n\r\n* `rounds`: The number of rounds/trials in each simulation\r\n* `repetitions`: How many times do you want to repeat the simulation?\r\n* `environment`: Here choose one of these environment/opponent models:\r\n  * `BernoulliEnvironment` is an environment with 2 bernoulli-distributed arms (p1 = 0.5, p2 = 0.6)\r\n  * `SwapEnvironment` implements the static _Flip_-strategy (oblivious enemy)\r\n  * `EvilEnvironment` implements the adaptive _Flip_-strategy (general enemy)\r\n\r\nRunning the simulation using `python plotter.py` will create 3 files in the subdirectory `./sim/`:\r\n\r\n1. A pickled data file containing the whole simulation\r\n2. A pdf showing a plot of the average cumulative regret over time\r\n3.
